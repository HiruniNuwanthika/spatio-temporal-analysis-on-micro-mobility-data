Use the scheduled data collection file to access the API and download data each minute.
After collecting data for at least a month, use the All functions file to extract trip starts and trip stops.
With that data and after merging with spatial features, create the dataset
Use NN, NBR, SVR and RFR models 
Then use graphs file
Similarly use trip stops dataset and create NN, NBR, RFR, SVR models
Finally use help buffer analysis file to create trip datasets
Use QGIS to create buffers and count trip stratr, stops.
